# Neural-Machine-Translation-Japanese-to-English
Japanese to English Translation using Neural Networks and NLP

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a Neural Machine Translation model to translate Japanese sentences into English. In the field of Natural Language Processing, transformer architectures have emerged as the leading framework, achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of tasks. Given their robustness and efficiency, transformers are expected to maintain their dominance in the near future. This project specifically utilizes the transformer architecture, as introduced in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need," to develop a highly effective neural network model. By leveraging the power of self-attention mechanisms and the transformer architecture, this model aims to achieve accurate and fluent translations from Japanese to English.
